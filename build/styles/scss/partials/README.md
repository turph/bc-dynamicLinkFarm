## Grid and Vertical Rhythm

You need to create a new layout-[site].scss file for a new site and define the parameters which dictate grid and typography layouts.
	1. Create layout-[site].scss file
	2. Input new values
	3. Open _layout.scss and @import your new file. (Make sure to comment out or delete other existing site imports)
